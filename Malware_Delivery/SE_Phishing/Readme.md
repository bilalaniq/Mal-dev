# üìå Phishing / Social Engineering

## üîπ What it is

Phishing and social engineering exploit the **human factor** rather than technical vulnerabilities.
The attacker **tricks a user** into doing something that helps deliver malware, such as:

* Opening a malicious file
* Clicking a dangerous link
* Entering credentials into a fake login page

## üîπ Common Phishing Types

1. **Email Phishing**

   * Most common.
   * Victim receives an email disguised as legitimate (bank, company, shipping service).
   * Attachments: malicious Word/Excel docs, ZIPs, executables.
   * Links: lead to credential-harvesting sites or malware downloads.

2. **Spear Phishing**

   * Targeted attack.
   * Example: Email sent specifically to an employee in finance, pretending to be their CEO asking for ‚Äúurgent invoice payment.‚Äù
   * Higher success rate than generic phishing.

3. **Whaling**

   * Aimed at high-value individuals (executives, managers).
   * Often uses legal or financial pretexts.

4. **Smishing & Vishing**

   * **Smishing** = phishing via SMS (links to fake websites or APKs).
   * **Vishing** = phishing via phone calls (scammers pretending to be IT, bank, or government).

5. **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**

   * Attackers compromise or spoof a business email account.
   * Used to trick employees into sending money or sensitive data.

## üîπ Techniques Used in Phishing Payloads

* **Malicious Attachments**

  * Word/Excel files with **macros** ‚Üí download malware when enabled.
  * PDFs with **JavaScript exploits**.
  * Password-protected ZIPs ‚Üí bypass AV/email filters.

* **Links to Exploit Kits / Malware Downloads**

  * Fake "Update your software" pages.
  * Drive-by downloads hosted on attacker-controlled sites.

* **Fake Login Pages**

  * Harvesting credentials (Office365, Gmail, Outlook).
  * Often hosted on lookalike domains (`micros0ft-support.com`).

## üîπ Real-World Examples

* **Emotet**: Spread massively via phishing emails with malicious Word docs.
* **TrickBot**: Frequently delivered after phishing emails to load ransomware.
* **Locky Ransomware**: Early widespread ransomware distributed through invoice-themed phishing.

## üîπ Defense Against Phishing

* **Technical Controls**

  * Email filtering & attachment scanning.
  * Disable macros by default.
  * Sandbox suspicious attachments.
  * Block known malicious domains/IPs.
  * Multi-factor authentication (prevents credential-only theft).

* **User Awareness**

  * Train employees to spot suspicious emails.
  * Teach to hover over links before clicking.
  * Verify requests for sensitive actions (e.g., money transfers).

* **Organizational Measures**

  * Incident reporting process (easy way to report phishing attempts).
  * Simulated phishing campaigns to test resilience.
