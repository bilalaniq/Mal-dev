# Auto Download

This is a simple demo showing how a website can trigger automatic file downloads when visited.
It’s designed for **educational and defensive research purposes only** (e.g., studying malware delivery methods such as drive-by downloads in a safe, controlled lab).

## 🚀 How It Works

* The `index.html` file uses a `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` tag to automatically redirect to a file (e.g., `myfile.zip` or `myfile.txt`).
* When deployed, opening the site in a browser immediately triggers the download (depending on file type).
* File types like `.zip` or `.exe` are usually downloaded by default.
* File types like `.txt` or `.pdf` may **open in the browser instead of downloading**, unless additional HTTP headers are set.

```
auto-download/
│

## 🌐 Deploying on Vercel

1. Install Vercel CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. Deploy from project folder:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
3. You’ll get a live URL like:

   ```
   https://auto-download-username.vercel.app
   ```

Opening this URL will start the download.
