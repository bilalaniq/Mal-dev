For me, the fascination isnâ€™t just in how malware works,
but in uncovering the paths it takes to reach its target.
Itâ€™s the delivery stage â€” the moment of entry â€”
that sparked my urge to explore and understand.

# ðŸ”¹ Common Malware Delivery Techniques


## 1. **Drive-by Downloads**

* **How it works**: Just visiting a compromised or malicious website triggers exploitation.
* **Techniques**:

  * Exploit kits (Angler, RIG, etc.) use browser/Flash/Java vulnerabilities.
  * Hidden iFrames to load exploits silently. click [here](./Drive-by-Downloads/hidden_iFrames/) to see how it works
* **Defense**:

  * Keep browsers and plugins patched.
  * Disable or remove unneeded plugins (Flash, Java).
  * Use browser isolation / sandboxing.

## 2. **Download and execute malware from a remote server**

* **How it works**: A malware might be hosted on a remote server and a dropper program can be used to download and execute it
The dropper itself may arrive via email attachment, malicious document, or social engineering trick.
Once executed, the dropper silently contacts a remote server (C2 â€” Command & Control) and downloads the actual malware payload (ransomware, spyware, trojan, etc.).
This two-stage approach helps attackers bypass antivirus (since the dropper looks harmless at first and the main payload comes later).

* **Techniques**:
   * Malicious macros in Office documents (.docm, .xlsm) that use PowerShell to fetch malware.
   * Script-based downloaders (.js, .vbs, .hta) that invoke bitsadmin, curl, or certutil.
   * Small EXE droppers that use Windows API calls (URLDownloadToFile, WinInet) to fetch payloads.
   * Fileless droppers that directly inject payloads into memory after download.

* **Famous examples**:

    * Emotet â†’ spread via malicious Word macros, downloaded banking trojans/ransomware.
    * Dridex â†’ downloader trojan delivered through email attachments.
    * BazarLoader â†’ dropped Cobalt Strike beacons for later intrusions.

## 4. **Watering Hole Attacks**

* **How it works**: Attacker compromises a site frequently visited by the target group (e.g., industry forums).
* **Result**: Visitors silently get malware delivered.
* **Defense**:

  * Use threat intelligence to monitor compromised sites.
  * Network-level IDS/IPS with known IoCs.
  * Keep endpoints patched.

## 5. **Malvertising**

* **How it works**: Attackers inject malicious ads into legitimate ad networks.
* **User sees ad â†’ ad loads exploit kit â†’ malware delivered.**
* **Defense**:

  * Ad-blocking in high-risk environments.
  * Browser isolation.
  * Endpoint protection.

## 6. **Removable Media (USB / External Drives)**

* **How it works**: USB drive spreads malware via autorun scripts or trick files.
* **Famous case**: Stuxnet spread partly via infected USBs.
* **Defense**:

  * Disable autorun.
  * Scan removable media.
  * Block unknown devices with endpoint policies.

## 7. **Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities**

* **How it works**: Attacker exploits unpatched software (Windows services, SMB, RDP, browsers).
* **Examples**:

  * EternalBlue exploit (WannaCry ransomware).
  * Zero-days in browsers or PDF readers.
* **Defense**:

  * Timely patching / vulnerability management.
  * IPS/IDS for exploit detection.
  * App whitelisting.

## 8. **Living off the Land (LoLBins)**

* **How it works**: Malware doesnâ€™t drop big binaries; instead, it abuses built-in tools:

  * `powershell.exe`, `wmic.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, `certutil.exe`.
* **Defense**:

  * Monitor for unusual command-line arguments.
  * Restrict script interpreters (PowerShell Constrained Language Mode, AMSI).
  * EDR solutions.

## 9. **Supply Chain Attacks**

* **How it works**: Attacker infects software updates or third-party libraries before they reach users.
* **Examples**:

  * SolarWinds Orion backdoor.
  * CCleaner compromise.
* **Defense**:

  * Verify software integrity (code signing).
  * Limit trust in third-party software.
  * Monitor abnormal app behavior.

## 10. **Fileless Malware**

* **How it works**: Payload lives in memory only, without writing to disk.
* **Techniques**:

  * Inject code into legitimate processes.
  * Use registry for persistence.
  * Download malicious scripts at runtime.
* **Defense**:

  * Use EDR with memory scanning.
  * Monitor anomalous PowerShell/WMI usage.
  * Harden OS against process injection.
