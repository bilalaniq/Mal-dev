# Ransomware:

Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts the victim’s files. The perpetrator
then demands a ransom from the victim in exchange for restoring access to the data. The
motive for ransomware attacks is typically monetary, and unlike other types of attacks, the
victim is typically informed of the exploit and given instructions on how to recover. To conceal
their identity, attackers frequently demand payment in a virtual currency, such as Bitcoin.
Ransomware attacks can be devastating, as they can result in the loss of sensitive or proprietary
data, disruption of regular operations, monetary losses incurred to restore systems and files,
and potential reputational damage to an organization. Real ransomware creation is unlawful 


Nonetheless, the following is a simplified example of file encryption using the Windows
API, which is a common component of ransomware


```cpp

#include <windows.h>
#include <wincrypt.h>

#pragma comment(lib, "crypt32.lib")

void encrypt_file(LPCWSTR filename) {
  // buffer to hold the plaintext and the ciphertext
  BYTE buffer[1024];
  DWORD bytesRead, bytesWritten;

  // open the original file, and create the new file
  HANDLE originalFile = CreateFile(filename, GENERIC_READ, 0, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
  HANDLE newFile = CreateFile(L"encrypted", GENERIC_WRITE, 0, NULL, CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);

  // Get a handle to the CSP
  HCRYPTPROV hProv;
  CryptAcquireContext(&hProv, NULL, NULL, PROV_RSA_FULL, CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT);

  // Generate the session key
  HCRYPTKEY hKey;
  CryptGenKey(hProv, CALG_RC4, CRYPT_EXPORTABLE, &hKey);

  // Read the plaintext file, encrypt the buffer, then write to the new file
  while(ReadFile(originalFile, buffer, sizeof(buffer), &bytesRead, NULL)) {
    CryptEncrypt(hKey, 0, bytesRead < sizeof(buffer), 0, buffer, &bytesRead, sizeof(buffer));
    WriteFile(newFile, buffer, bytesRead, &bytesWritten, NULL);
  }

  // Clean up
  CryptReleaseContext(hProv, 0);
  CryptDestroyKey(hKey);
  CloseHandle(originalFile);
  CloseHandle(newFile);
}

int main() {
  encrypt_file(L"test.txt");
  return 0;
}
```



This is a simple example that demonstrates file encryption, which is a part of what ransomware
does. However, it does not include other elements such as user notifications, ransom demands,
key management (importantly, key destruction), network spreading, or any kind of persistence
or anti-detection mechanisms. Also, it’s not using a secure encryption mode
